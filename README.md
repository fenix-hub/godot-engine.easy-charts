# Available Charts and when to use them    
This library offers a set of charts for each main Godot Node:   
- ![control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.easy-charts/036d7126a16547ff1f1199531160cd1e1b01dc72/addons/easy_charts/utilities/icons/linechart.svg) **Control Charts:** Fast Charts plotted in a Control Node. They offer basic Control properties, such as Margins, size inheritance and control. No animations, best suited for UIs that rely on Control Node structures.
- **2D Charts:** plotted in 2D Nodes. They offer additional tools, such as animations. They can be used to implement more aesthetic charts in 2D contexts. Compatibility not guaranteed in Canvas and Control nodes.
- **3D Charts:** Plotted using 3D nodes, but can be used both in 2D and 3D spaces. They offer the possibility to plot 3D datasets, which are common in machine learning contexts or just data analysis. A Camera Control will also be available, which can be used to move around the chart.
